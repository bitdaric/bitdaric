# BitDaric Core [DARX]
==========================

## What is BitDaric?
BitDaric is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin, BitDaric currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt with a target time of 1 minute per block and difficulty readjustment every day.

Coin supply is limitless controlled over the time. Block rewards are 7000000 for first 4 blocks. Then multiply 10 by 1 point every #7,000,000 blocks, until it reach 100 points. After that it would be a fixed value of multiply 10 by 100 points (1000 rewards).

Estimated block generation is 1 per minute so rewards of every block would be 10 for first 26 years and then would be 20 for 39 years and so on...

Here is calculation of coin supply over the time (if block generation would be as fast as 1 per minute):

Year | Approx. coins | Rewards
------|----------|-----------
1 | 66,166,320 | 10
2 | 71,422,320 | 10
3 | 76,678,320 | 10
4 | 81,934,320 | 10
